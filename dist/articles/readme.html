<hr>
<p>this is a blog and a static site generator<br />
simply converts a folder of markdown files to a blog webpage</p>
<p>todos/bugs</p>
<ul>
<li>no testing yet</li>
<li>Does not check for directory from which the program is run, leading to bugs (to fix this dont hardcode directory names)</li>
<li>using templating for generating html intead of using raw strings for correctness</li>
<li>adding color themes or custom theming in the user config</li>
<li>too many unwraps</li>
<li>hacky solution to check if running for base directory, set a base directory on each run</li>
<li>add overide for filename to not be the name of the article</li>
<li>sort it chronologically, use flags to add a new article eg- pond add “moon river” (maybe)</li>
<li>non markdown files in the content directory need to be ignored</li>
<li>refactoring utils dir into logical .rs files?</li>
</ul>
<p>some ideas for usabilty and performance</p>
<ul>
<li>should probably add a file mode to watch a specific file for changes and then update it</li>
<li>maybe i should watch all the files for changes and then update specifi file but then again idk how it iwll handle file name changes </li>
<li>if the folder dretects change then we can rerender the entire thing, otherwise we can partially update the articles that are being watched specifically??</li>
<li>former overrides the latter</li>
</ul>
<p>state</p>
<ul>
<li>maintaing an internal state could be useful in some cases but using the content folder as the single source of truth is very powerful</li>
<li>FEATURE IDEA -&gt; a period ‘.’ in front of the filename for drafts or hidden articles</li>
</ul>
